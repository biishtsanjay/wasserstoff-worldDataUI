## TECH STACK...

React Js
SCSS
and various libraries.

## Libraries...

    "apexcharts": "^3.37.2",
    "node-sass": "^7.0.3",
    "react": "^18.2.0",
    "react-apexcharts": "^1.4.0",
    "react-bootstrap": "^2.7.2",
    "react-dom": "^18.2.0",
    "react-icons": "^4.7.1",
    "react-router-dom": "^6.8.1",
    "react-scripts": "5.0.1",
    "recharts": "^2.5.0",
    "react-simple-maps": "^3.0.0",

## Approach...

1. Created project using npx create-react-app <project-name>.
2. Installed the packages and dependencies which are required for project.
3. Installed sass for designing my component.

After reading through the entire figma thoroughly I broke project into a small component. First made Navbar, Footer, and Sidebar, and after that came to the MapDesign, Bar chart. For that I used react libraries which was mentioned above. For navigation I used "react-router-dom" library, for map I used "react-simple-map" library, and for barCharts I used "recharts" library for styling I used SASS. I faced challenges in making mapdesign compounents and barCharts components.
